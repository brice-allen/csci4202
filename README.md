# CSCI4202 Homework 1

This is a program written in Go that solves the 8-puzzle problem using two search algorithms: breadth-first search and A* search.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brice-allen/csci4202.git
```bash

2. Navigate to the hw01 directory:

```bash
cd csci4202/hw01
```bash

3. Build the program: 


```bash
go build
```bash

4. Run the program with one of the following commands: 

```bash
./hw01 astar
```bash


```bash
./hw01 bfs
```bash


The program takes input from a file named input.txt in the same directory and outputs the solution (if found) and some statistics about the search.
